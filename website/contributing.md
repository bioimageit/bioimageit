## Ways to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to BioImageIT, even if you don't write code:

* **Reporting Bugs:** If you find something that's not working as expected, please let us know.
* **Suggesting Enhancements:** Have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one? We'd love to hear it.
* **Writing or Improving Documentation:** Clear documentation is crucial. Help us make ours better.
* **Submitting Code Fixes or New Features:** Contribute directly to the codebase via Pull Requests.
* **Adding or Improving Tests:** Help ensure BioImageIT is robust and reliable.
* **Integrating New Analysis Tools:** Expand the ecosystem by wrapping new tools for use within BioImageIT.
* **Reviewing Pull Requests:** Lend your expertise to review contributions from others.
* **Answering Questions:** Help other users by answering questions on the issue tracker or other communication channels.

## Reporting Bugs

Before submitting a bug report, please:

1.  **Check the existing issues:** Search the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/bioimageit/bioimageit/issues) to see if someone has already reported the same bug.
2.  **Update to the latest version:** Ensure you are using the most recent version of BioImageIT, as the bug might have already been fixed.

If the bug persists and hasn't been reported, please open a new issue. Include as much detail as possible:

* A clear and descriptive title.
* Steps to reproduce the bug consistently.
* What you expected to happen.
* What actually happened (include error messages, logs, or screenshots if possible).
* Your environment details (Operating System, BioImageIT version, Python version, relevant package versions).

## Suggesting Enhancements

We welcome suggestions for new features and improvements! To suggest an enhancement:

1.  **Check existing issues:** Search the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/bioimageit/bioimageit/issues) to see if a similar enhancement has already been proposed.
2.  Open a new issue detailing your suggestion.
    * Provide a clear and descriptive title.
    * Explain the enhancement and why it would be valuable to BioImageIT users.
    * Describe the proposed functionality. Include mockups or examples if helpful.
    * Outline potential implementation ideas if you have them.

## Your First Code Contribution

Ready to dive into the code? Hereâ€™s how to get started:

### Finding an Issue

* Look for issues tagged with `good first issue` or `help wanted` in the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/bioimageit/bioimageit/issues). These are typically suitable for newcomers.
* If you want to work on an issue, please leave a comment saying so. This helps avoid duplicated effort.
* If you have an idea that doesn't have an associated issue, consider creating one first to discuss the approach with the maintainers.

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Git and [Pixi](https://pixi.sh) installed.
2.  **Fork the Repository:** Click the "Fork" button on the [BioImageIT GitHub page](https://github.com/bioimageit/bioimageit/) to create your own copy.
3.  **Clone Your Fork:** `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/bioimageit.git`
4.  **Navigate to the Directory:** `cd bioimageit`
5.  **Set up the development environment:** This will install the development dependencies and start a new shell for development
    ```bash
    pixi shell -e dev
    ```
6.  You can now start the project with `ipython` (`ipython --pdb -- pyflow.py`)  and run tests (`ipython -m unittest --pdb PyFlow/Tests/Test_Tools.py`).

### Making Changes

1.  **Create a New Branch:** Start from the main development branch `dev`. Create a descriptive branch name:
    ```bash
    # Example for a new feature:
    git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature-name
    # Example for a bug fix:
    git checkout -b fix/issue-123-fix-description
    ```
2.  **Write Your Code:** Make your changes, focusing on the specific issue or feature.
3.  **Follow Coding Style:** Ensure your code adheres to the project's coding style guidelines (see [Coding Style](#coding-style)).
4.  **Add Tests:** Include new tests for your changes or update existing ones as needed (see [Testing](#testing)).
5.  **Update Documentation:** If your changes affect user-facing functionality or APIs, update the relevant documentation.
6.  **Commit Your Changes:** Use clear and concise commit messages. Reference the issue number if applicable (e.g., `git commit -m "feat: Add feature X (closes #123)"`).
7.  **Push to Your Fork:** `git push origin your-branch-name`

### Testing

* **How to run tests:** `ipython -m unittest --pdb PyFlow/Tests/Test_Tools.py` (with the developement environment activated with `pixi shell -e dev`)
* **Test Coverage:** For now, tests are only required for the processing tools.
* **Requirement:** All new code contributions should ideadlly include relevant tests. Bug fixes should ideally include a test that reproduces the bug.

## Pull Request Process

Once your changes are ready:

1.  **Go to your fork** on GitHub.
2.  Click the "New pull request" button.
3.  Ensure the base repository is `bioimageit/bioimageit` and the base branch is the correct development branch `dev`.
4.  Ensure the head repository is your fork and the compare branch is the one with your changes.
5.  **Fill out the Pull Request Template:** Provide a clear description of your changes, why they are needed, and link any relevant issues (e.g., "Closes #123").
6.  **Ensure Checks Pass:** Verify that tests pass successfully.
7.  **Respond to Feedback:** Maintainers or other contributors may review your PR and request changes. Be responsive to feedback and push updates to your branch as needed.
8.  **Merging:** Once approved and checks pass, a maintainer will merge your Pull Request. Congratulations!

## Coding Style

* **Python:** Please follow the code style used in the codebased (loosely based on [PEP8 formatting style](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)).

## Documentation

* **Location:** `website/`
* **Format:** Markdown with Sphinx
* **Building:** `sphinx-autobuild -a website build` (with the docs environment activated, `pixi shell -e docs`)

## Integrating New Tools

BioImageIT is designed to be extensible. We encourage contributions that integrate new bioimage analysis tools.

See the [Adding and creating tools](documentation/tool_integration.md) documentation for more information.

## Communication

* **GitHub Issues:** The primary channel for bug reports, feature requests, and discussion related to specific code changes.
* [**Github Discussions**](https://github.com/bioimageit/bioimageit/discussions/landing)
